      <h4 className="history">
        Shree Trader's was founded in August 2020 by Sanjay Saini, a MBA gradute
        who recognized the need for high-quality and affordable sanitary
        products in his community. Starting with a small storefront in downtown,
        the shop quickly gained a reputation for its knowledgeable staff and
        wide selection of products. In 2022, the shop expanded to a larger
        location to accommodate its growing customer base. Over the years, Shree
        Trader's has continued to evolve and adapt to meet the changing needs of
        its customers. In mid 2022, the shop introduced a line of eco-friendly
        and sustainable products, reflecting its commitment to environmental
        responsibility. In 2023, the shop launched an online store, making it
        easier for customers to shop from the comfort of their own homes. Today,
        Shree Trader's is proud to be a trusted resource for all things
        sanitation, serving customers both locally and online. With a focus on
        customer service, quality products, and sustainability, the shop is
        dedicated to promoting health and wellness in its community and beyond.
